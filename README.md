## Protocol Overview

The **Stake Together** protocol functions as a staking pool mechanism, allowing users to create and deposit ether into staking pools. Each deposit results in the issuance of an **stpETH** token as collateral.

When the total staked ether reaches 32 ETH, a validator oracle is triggered to create a validator. This ether is then transferred to the beacon chain.

Reports are generated daily by oracles and, once a consensus among them is reached, and after a certain delay, the report is executed. This can lead to various actions, including sending ETH to the **Stake Together** contract, the **Withdrawals** contract, and generating airdrop rewards in the **Airdrop** contract.

Users can request withdrawals, which are processed by the **Stake Together** contract or, in the absence of liquidity, can burn stpETH to generate stwETH.

## Contract Summaries
